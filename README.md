## Minecraft Earth added 7 pig variants, and with the new pig variant features in snapshot 25w02a, this datapack brings those pigs into the vanilla game!
_Includes a required resource pack_

### Added Pigs:
- Pale pig: spawns in the Meadow biome
- Piebald pig: spawns in the Jungle biomes
- Spotted pig: spawns alongside normal pigs
- Pink Footed pig: spawns in the Cherry Grove biome
- Mottled pig: spawns in the Dark Oak Forest biome
- Sooty pig: spawns alongside normal pigs
- Muddy pig: spawns in the Mangrove and Swamp biomes
  - _NOTE: This does not include the top flower_
  - inlcudes the Dried Muddied variant, which spawns in the Swamp biome.

**NOTE:** Pig Variants are still considered "experiemental" and this datapack relies on snapshot features. Make sure to back up your worlds before using this pack.
